# Manzil - Built on NextJS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Setup Environment Variables

- Create `.env` file in the folder where you find your `package.json` file. Inside the `.env` file, add the line `NEXT_PUBLIC_QURAN_BASE_URL=https://api.quran.com/api/v4`

- Or you can rename the `env.example` file to `.env` and you should be good to go.

2. Run the following command to install Next.js using yarn

```
yarn add next
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev # Recommended
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

4. If you encounter an issue with Node.js version compatibility, use Node Version Manager to resolve the conflict.

Example:

```
nvm install [TARGET VERSION]
nvm use [TARGET VERSION]
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
